//JAVASCRIPT appears to pass by reference but in reality it cant do that
//it passes a value that contains a memory address
//so basically it passes a reference but it doesnt pass BY reference

/*
In programming languages, Arguments can be passed by value, or passed by reference.

- JavaScript works only passing by value.

- When we pass primitive values, the function works with a value, 
which is a copy of the original value.

- When we pass an object, the function works with a value, 
which is a copy of the reference that address to the spot in the memory 
where the original object is in the memory (still is not a reference).

-So, the subtle thing that makes JS different from some other languages, 
is that the reference to an object is in itself a value, 
that's why we only have passing by value, basically.

//FIRST-CLASS AND HIGHER-ORDER FUNCTIONS

//FIRST CLASS FUNCTIONS
//Functions are treated as values
//Functions are just another "type" of object

//Store functions in variables or properties
const add = (a,b) => a+b;
const counter = {
    value:1,
    inc: function() {this.value++}
}

//Pass functions as arugments to Other functions
//const greet = () => console.log('Hello!');
//btn.addEvenListener('click',greet)

//Return functions from functions
//Call methods on functions counter.inc.bind(someotherobject) (bind on another lesson)


//HIGHER ORDER FUNCTIONS
//A function that RECEIVES another function as an argument, that RETURNS a new function or both
//Possible because of first-class functions

//Function that receives another function
//const greet = () => console.log('Hello!');
//btn.addEvenListener('click',greet)
//addEventListener is a higher order function and greet is a callback function (callbacks on another lesson)

//Function that returns a new function
function count(){//Higher order function
    let counter = 0;
    return function (){ //returned function
        counter++;
    }
